# Day 7 - Hangman

## üìùProject 7: Hangman Game
- Hangman is a simple word guessing game.
- The player trys to figure out an unknown word by guessing letters.
- If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses).
  
- The game is set up by drawing a gallow and an underline for each letter in the unknown word.
- As letters in the word are guessed, they are written in place of the cooresponding underline.
- If the player guesses a letter not in the word, a picture of a person on the gallow is drawn ‚Äì one part for each incorrect letter guess.
- Most frequently, the person is drawn in 6 parts (for 6 letter guesses) in the order: head, body, left leg, right leg, left arm, right arm.
