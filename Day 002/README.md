# Day 2 - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

## ü´ôProject 2: Tip Calculator
- We're going to build a tip calculator.
- If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
- Each person should pay:
  - (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
- After formatting the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏èConcepts Practised
- Python Primitive Data Types
- Type Error, Type Checking and Type Conversion
- Data Types
- Mathematical Operations in Python
- Number Manipulation and F Strings in Python
