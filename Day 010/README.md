# Day 10 - Functions with Outputs

## üßÆProject 10: Calculator
### Main functionality
- Program asks the user to type:
  - the first number.
  - a mathematical operator (a choice of "+", "-", "*" or "/")
  - the second number.
- Program works out the result based on the chosen mathematical operator.
- Program asks if the user wants to continue working with the previous result.
- If yes, program loops to use the previous result as the first number and then repeats the calculation process.
- If no, program asks the user for the fist number again and wipes all memory of previous calculations.
- Add the logo from art.py

### Functionality I added:
- adds an option to end the program and not continue calculating
- catches Value Errors when an invalid number is typed by the user
- catches Key Errors when an invalid operation is typed by the user (and therefore cannot be retrieved in the dictionary) 

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏èConcepts Practised
- Function with Outputs
- Multiple return values
- Docstrings
- Combining Dictionaries and Functions
- Print vs. Return
- While Loops, Flags and Recursion
