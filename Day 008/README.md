## 👩‍💻Project 8: Caesar Cipher
- The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encrypting messages, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to protect his military communications
- This technique involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of places.
- For example, with a shift of three, the letter ‘A’ **encoded** becomes ‘D’ and the letter 'A' **decoded** becomes 'X'.
