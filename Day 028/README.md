# Day 28 - Tkinter, Dynamic Typing and the Pomodoro GUI Application

## ⌛Project 28: Pomodoro Timer App
- Create a Pomodoro Timer with the Tkinter module
- Pomodoro Technique:
  1. Decide on the task to be done.
  2. Set the Pomodoro timer (25 minutes).
  3. Work on the task.
  4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (5 minutes).
  5. Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four working sessions.
  6. After four working sessions are done, take a long break (20 minutes) instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
