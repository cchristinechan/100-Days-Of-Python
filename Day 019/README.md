# Day 19 - Instances, State and Higher Order Functions

## 🐢Project 19: Turtles Racing
- The user is asked to input their bet on which colour turtle will win.
- Each turtle moves forward by a random integer between 0 and 10.
- The python console will print whether you won or lost based on which turtle reached the right-hand side of the screen first.

## ▶️Concepts Practised
- Python Higher Order Functions & Event Listeners
- Object State and Instances
- The Turtle Coordinate System
